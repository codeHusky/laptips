#### How do I contribute?
Go to the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/codeHusky/user.gripe) and create a Pull Request with any changes you'd like to make, new pages, etc.

Trusted folks can request direct contributor access in the Jedi Pastas Discord server. If you're not sure what that is, stick to [Pull Requests](https://github.com/codeHusky/user.gripe/pulls).

Eventually, there may be a built-in editor for people with accounts. This is not fully planned and may be deemed unneeded because of the GitHub repo.
