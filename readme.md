### What is user.gripe?
user.gripe is a website full of crowdsourced information curated by tech enthusiasts.
This site serves as a way to easily share large amounts of reliable information about tech with others online. Anyone can contribute.

### What's appropriate for user.gripe?
Technically, this is just a collection of information about consumer technology. At the moment, though, this site mainly focuses on computer hardware.

If you think your particular niche would benefit from being on this site, create an issue on the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/codeHusky/user.gripe)
and we'll consider it!

### How do I contribute?
Go to the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/codeHusky/user.gripe) and create a Pull Request with any changes you'd like to make, new pages, etc.
Be sure to check the [Contribution Guide](https://user.gripe/contributing) for details.

Trusted folks can request direct contributor access in the Jedi Pastas Discord server. If you're not sure what that is, stick to [Pull Requests](https://github.com/codeHusky/user.gripe/pulls).

Eventually, there may be a built-in editor for people with accounts. This is not fully planned and may be deemed unneeded because of the GitHub repo.

### Isn't this kind of like rentry.org?
user.gripe is very similar in premise to rentry.org, but differs in that it's not a pastebin service.
The format of rentry.org accomplishes much of what this site does, but falls short in the access control and reliability departments.

Some folks were creating rentry.org pages with information that was "low quality" at best.
This site exists as an alternative with exclusively reliable information, saving many from confusion into the future.
