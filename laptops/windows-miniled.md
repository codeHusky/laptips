# MiniLED on Windows Laptops
MiniLED technology, at least as of 2023, has not been perfected for use on Windows laptops.

There are numerous issues with current implementations, but here are the most notable of them.

### Blooming
In essence, the low number of zones present on Windows MiniLED systems results in a "glowing" effect in some instances.
This effect is most notable on grey backgrounds while moving a cursor around, resulting in neighboring areas brightening.

### Uneven Backlighting 
While displaying certain solid colors, certain MiniLED panels will render that color in a way that has "splotchy dark patches."
This is an unfortunate byproduct of the low number of zones, as well as issues with the diffusion layers on these early panels.

### Response Times
Even on the MacBooks, MiniLED has response time problems. In moments of high contrast, some panels will struggle to keep up and will smear content.
This can result in text, video, or game content becoming smudgy.
In certain cases, this may appear as trailing darkness or light bloom following moving objects, such as application windows.

## Workarounds
On ASUS ROG machines, users can use Armoury Crate to access a MiniLED mode button.
This allows switching between a single-zone and multi-zone mode.
In most cases, this fixes all of the issues mentioned previously.

For other devices, there does not appear to be a way to set the MiniLED panels to single zone mode.
Until a workaround exists, the aforementioned issues may be present in your daily workflow or gaming habits.
